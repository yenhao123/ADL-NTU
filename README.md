>predict the class of words

## Hw2
Use Bert to solve Mutiple Choice and Question Answering problems.

Framework
* Huggingface : to offer datasets and models to train mutiple tasks. (e.g, machine translation、summarization) 

Mutiple Choice
>Give choices and predict answer, e.g, ending2 is the answer.

```
"ending0": "looks at a mirror in the mirror as he watches someone walk through a door.",
"ending1": "stops, listening to a cup of coffee with the seated woman, who's standing.",
"ending2": "exits the building and rides the motorcycle into a casino where he performs several tricks as people watch.",
"ending3": "pulls the bag out of his pocket and hands it to someone's grandma.",
"label": 2,
```

Question Answering
>Give you question and predict the answer

## Hw3
Use mt5-small to solve the Summarization problem

>Give you maintext and predict the title
